# Social Media App

![App Preview](./social_media.gif)

> This project consists of applying our knowledge of Ruby on Rails to a real social media app. The challenge here was to develop ways of adding friends, accepting/rejecting friend requests and being able to like and comment posts created by the users

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.0
- Ruby on Rails v5.2.4


## Live Demo

[Live Demo](https://fakebookalexkelyn.herokuapp.com/)


### Usage

Once you open the link on your browser, you are asked to login in order to be able to see your posts and your friends' posts.

By clicking the "Sign Up" button you are able to create your account after you fill in the necessary fields.

You now can create a post and share whatever you want with your friends! If you do not have friends for now, add them. Networking is everything!

Do not want to be friends with 'RealJustinBieber3'? You can reject the friend request at will. 

Moreover, you are able to see all the users and all your friends on the 'All Users' and 'Friendship' pages respectively!


### Getting Started (For Developers)
```
Open Terminal
run git clone git@github.com:abouhid/Social_media_app.git
run cd Social_media_app
run bundle install
run rake db:migrate
run rails s
```
Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Run tests
To run the tests:

### Deployment

This project has been deployed on Heroku using the `Heroku CLI` and a continuous deployment pipeline has been setup between Heroku and GitHub.
## Instructions
Once inside the application, you have to create an account since you are a new user so as to be able to enjoy all that the web app has to offer. Once you've created the application, you can use the navigation links to navigate anywhere within the page.
